# What is visualizeR?

`visualizeR` is an R package for climate data visualization, with special focus on ensemble forecasting and uncertainty communication. It includes functions for visualizing climatological, forecast and evaluation products, and combinations of them.  

This package is part of the [**climate4R bundle**], formed by [loadeR](https://github.com/SantanderMetGroup/loadeR), [transformeR](https://github.com/SantanderMetGroup/transformeR), [downscaleR](https://github.com/SantanderMetGroup/downscaleR) and visualizeR.

The recommended installation procedure is to use the `install_github` command from the devtools R package. See the [installation info](https://github.com/SantanderMetGroup/visualizeR/wiki/installation) instructions in the GitHub [wiki](https://github.com/SantanderMetGroup/visualizeR/wiki).

```r
devtools::install_github(c("SantanderMetGroup/transformeR", "SantanderMetGroup/visualizeR"))
```
**IMPORTANT:** Note that `transformeR` must be previously installed on your system
