# What is visualizeR?

`visualizeR` is an R package implementing a set of advanced visualization tools for forecast verification. It is fully integrated (yet independent) from the R climate data structures generated by the loading functions of the `loadeR` bundle (including the `loadeR.ECOMS` interface to the [ECOMS-UDG](https://meteo.unican.es/trac/wiki/udg/ecoms), thus providing seamless integration with all steps of forecast data analysis, from data loading to post-processing, downscaling and bias correction and visualization.

The recommended installation procedure is to use the `install_github` command from the devtools R package. 

```r
devtools::install_github("SantanderMetGroup/visualizeR")
```
Alternatively, you can download the sources from the [Releases Tab](https://github.com/SantanderMetGroup/visualizeR/releases)


**IMPORTANT:** Note that `downscaleR` need to be previously installed on your system [(installation info)](https://github.com/SantanderMetGroup/downscaleR/wiki)
