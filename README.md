# What is visualizeR?

`visualizeR` is an R package implementing a set of advanced visualization tools for forecast verification. It is fully integrated (yet independent) from the R climate data structures generated by the loading functions of the `loadeR` bundle (including the `loadeR.ECOMS` interface to the [ECOMS-UDG](https://meteo.unican.es/trac/wiki/udg/ecoms), thus providing seamless integration with all steps of forecast data analysis, from data loading to post-processing, downscaling and bias correction and visualization.
